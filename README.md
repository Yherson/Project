# TranslateSRT
#### Video Demo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EehW2bxjZY
#### Description:

TranslateSRT emerged in response to a need identified during CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course, offered by the edX platform. We observed a focus on content in different languages ​​to English, which led us to conceive the idea of ​​translating the subtitle files of the course videos. Our mission is to provide a more inclusive and accessible educational experience by offering subtitles in multiple languages, allowing a broader audience to benefit from the course content.

### Description and context:

This web application consists of generating .srt (SubRip Subtitle) files, the objective is to include subtitles in any video that only provides subtitles in one language. By translating these subtitles you can include them in your videos and you will be able to see the subtitles without delay compared to the video.

### Access to the Platform
